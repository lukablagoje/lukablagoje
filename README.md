- üî¨ Currently working as a Researcher in Graph Data Science at the Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University.
- üíª Skilled in Python (Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn), and SQL.
- üåê Fluent in English, Serbian.
- üì´ Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lukablagoje/).

## Education üéì
- üéì PhD in Network Science from Central European University, Vienna, Austria (2020-2024).
- üìö Bachelor's and Master's in Experimental and Theoretical Physics from University of Belgrade, Serbia (2014-2019).
# Academic Research Projects
### The Impact of Physicality on Network Structure
- **Publication**: [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02267-1) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/the-impact-of-physicality-on-network-structure)
  - As a contributing author, developed collision-detection algorithms for $10^{6}$ objects with approximately 3000 unique labels.
  - Detected spatial neighbors by computing pairwise distances of 3D objects, computed with point clouds and kd-trees.
  - Using graph analysis, found a relationship of neuron synaptic connections to the number of their spatial neighbors.

### Temporal Patterns of Reciprocity in Communication Networks
- **Publication**: [EPJ Data Science](https://epjds.epj.org/articles/epjdata/abs/2023/01/13688_2023_Article_382/13688_2023_Article_382.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/temporal-patterns-of-reciprocity-in-communication-networks)
  - As a contributing author, cleaned and processed the data of 6 timestamped graph datasets (e.g., emails, Twitter).
  - Performed null hypothesis testing for 4 reference null models (randomized timestamps and graph topology).
  - Discovered statistically significant results that Twitter exchanges are less reciprocal and bursty than SMS, calls, and emails.

### Three-Dimensional Shape and Connectivity of Physical Networks
- **Publication**: [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19333) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/three-dimensional-shape-connectivity-physical-networks)
  - As a leading author, performed a comprehensive data processing and analysis of 15 volumetric 3D graph datasets.
  - Developed algorithms to quantify the shape, size, and geometry of the data (e.g., fractal dimension, edge volume).
  - Created a pipeline that randomizes physical edge trajectories to detect obstacles for more than $10^{5}$ edges at once.

### Physical Network Robustness
- **Status**: In progress | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/physical_network_robustness)
  - As a leading author, simulating 2D and 3D graphs physical attacks (spatial edge removal) in their embedding space.
  - Developing a measure to quantify the connectivity of spatial regions in which the graph (network) is embedded.

# Applied Data Science Projects

### Quantifying and Ranking User Engagement with Clickbait Articles Using NLP-Created Features
- **Event**: Citadel - Correlation One Global PhD Datathon 2023 | [Competition Link](https://www.citadel.com/careers/students/datathons/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/citadel_correlation_one_global_phd_datathon_2023)
  - Utilized NLP methods to analyze sentiment, emotion, and topic of text data.
  - Analyzed click-through rates using Google Analytics data to understand user engagement drivers.
  - Developed a custom ranking system for clickbait articles based on their performance metrics (daily, aggregate, and top 5%).

### Dynamic XGBoost-Based Model on a Data Stream for Stock Price Prediction
- **Event**: Optiver - Trading at the Close (Kaggle) Competition | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/lukablagoje/xgboost-pipeline/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/dynamic-XGBoost-model-data-stream-prediction)
  - Led a 3-member team to implement an XGBoost model on a data stream for predicting stock prices.
  - Focused on optimizing hyperparameters with k-fold cross-validation, tailored for time-series data, and included periodic retraining.
  - Established an automated pipeline for data-stream tasks, including data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

### Algorithmic Trading Leveraging Group Trends in Graph Representation
- **Organization**: WUTIS - Academic Trading And Investment Society | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7093246370429476865/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/lukablagoje/algo-trading-group-trends-graphs/tree/main)
  - As a leader of a 4-member team, achieved a first-place victory in the Algorithmic Trading pitch competition.
  - Created a graph representation based on the cross-correlation of stock price time-series data to identify group trends.
  - Backtested an algorithmic trading strategy focused on stocks deviating and returning to group trends.
